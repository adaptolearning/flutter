### About Adapto Learning

We exist to build innovative digital learning experiences for all who wish to learn, and we love how easy Flutter makes that. We hope this repository helps to you to catch what you have missed out! We'd love to hear from you!

<br/>

### Installation

If you're new to Flutter the first thing you'll need is to follow the [setup instructions](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install). Once you're set up and can compile the sample Flutter app, you're ready to run some vignettes!

Each vignette is stored in its own folder in the repository. Using your IDE of choice, open the vignette directory you'd like to run. Then, using the terminal inside your IDE, run `flutter pub get` to fetch any dependencies, and `flutter run` to deploy to your connected device or simulator.

If you would like to try these for Flutter for web, you can use `flutter run -d chrome`. Note that Flutter for web is currently a technical preview and not all of the vignettes will work correctly. For more information on enabling Flutter for web follow the [setup instructions](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/web).
